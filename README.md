# tool

## Purpose

Aligned chat models conflate two different jobs: being agreeable, and being
correct. For science and engineering only the second one matters. When the
empirical answer is politically inconvenient, the alignment layer files the
corners off; the result reads fluently but is no longer reliable as input
to real work. `tool` separates the jobs: local uncensored models give
factual answers, and any phrasing the user wants on top of that is added
by the user, not the model.

The other half of the problem is the *input*. People type loosely:
abbreviations, ambiguous nouns, missing units, half a thought. Chat models
silently guess what was meant; the guesses are often wrong, but the prose
is fluent enough that the failure is invisible. `tool` makes the
interpretation step explicit. Every prompt passes through a pipeline:
spell-correction, intent classification, dictionary lookup of every
ambiguous word, several precise rewrites, an expertise router, a
disambiguation step. Only the fully-resolved query is handed to the
answering model. Each stage is visible in the chat trail, so you see what
the system thought you meant before it tried to answer.

Worse than the visible hedging is what you don't see. Hosted models layer
behavior on top of the weights: provider-side system prompts you never
read, RLHF that pushes the model toward favored conclusions, content-class
detectors that quietly switch the model into a different mode when your
topic crosses an internal line, and output-side filters that paraphrase or
strip before the response reaches you. Which of those fire depends on what
you're working on. The pattern is consistent: the model is helpful right
up to the point where the work is about to do something real, then it
sabotages. Answers go vague, code regresses, hedging preambles appear, the
thread it was tracking ten turns ago is just gone. This isn't speculation;
the same labs that train these models have published evaluations where
their own systems were caught sabotaging work that conflicted with what
the training process selected for. `tool` exists because of that pattern.
Local weights, no provider in the path, every step of the interpretation
chain visible in the trail. When the answer is bad it's because the model
is bad at the task, not because someone upstream decided the user
shouldn't be allowed to finish.

`tool` distributes the work across many small abliterated specialists
rather than one large filtered generalist. A loose prompt is cleaned,
classified, grounded in dictionary definitions, rewritten into precise
candidates, routed by expertise, and disambiguated before any answering
model is touched. The answering model is then handed real tools so it can
finish a job instead of describing one. Every stage is visible in the
chat trail; the work runs on whatever local hardware you have, single box
or cluster; sessions persist per browser tab.

## Experiments

Try this: take a topic mainstream chat models reliably hedge on, ask the
question casually, and watch the hedging machinery engage. Disclaimers,
"it's complicated," restated-question dodges, redirection to safer
adjacent topics. The same prompt, run through the first few layers of
`tool`'s pipeline (cleanup, classification, dictionary grounding, precise
rewrites, expertise routing, final render), comes out the other side
phrased so specifically that the alignment layer has nothing left to
hedge into. Given the rewritten prompt, the flagship model answers the
question directly.

The lesson is small but load-bearing: alignment hedging is parasitic on
ambiguity at the input boundary. Once a prompt has been parsed, grounded,
disambiguated, and rewritten as a precise empirical question, the model
cannot restate the question to stall, cannot "but it depends" its way
out, and cannot redirect to a safer adjacent topic; it has to answer.
Precision is itself an alignment bypass, and that holds even on the
hosted flagship models the technique was meant to route around. Early
signal, not a controlled study. More of these are worth running.

The second experiment was about composition: how far could a chain of
small specialized abliterated models go before the seams showed? The
capability held up. The knowledge didn't. Small models reason fine but
don't carry enough world knowledge on their own to ground answers in
concrete fact, and asking them to recall what they don't reliably know
is where the wheels come off. The fix was to bolt actual reference
material onto the side of the pipeline: the entire Wikipedia corpus as a
local ZIM, a stack of dictionaries, and thesauruses. The pipeline queries
them at the grounding stages, so the answering model gets the facts in
front of it instead of being asked to recall them.

The lesson is parallel to the first: small + specialized +
reference-grounded turns out to cover most of what a medium-sized hosted
model gets right, without the alignment tax. Knowledge breadth is a
deployment problem, not a model-size problem.

## Current State

The pipeline is wired and operating. A loose prompt walks through
cleanup, entity recognition, classification, dictionary lookup,
stylize-rewrite, expertise routing, and disambiguation before the
resolved query reaches a domain specialist.

The assistant dispatches into real tools to do real work, and where the
prompt is still ambiguous, the pipeline stops and asks the user.

When the disambiguation stage cannot pick a clear interpretation from
the stylize candidates, it asks the user one targeted clarifying
question and stops the pipeline until an answer comes back. Mainstream
chat models will do something similar on occasion, but as a soft
heuristic baked into the answering model itself; the behavior is opaque
and inconsistent (you get questions sometimes, hedged guesses other
times). In `tool` it's an explicit pipeline stage with its own
implementation, deterministic about when it fires (the rewrite
candidates still disagree on a load-bearing word). The user pays in one
extra round-trip; the answer that comes back is grounded in something
the user actually meant.

## Tasks

- ✅ **Prompt cleanup** _(in testing)_: first stage of the pipeline. A strict copy-editor pass over the raw user input that fixes spelling, grammar, pronoun case, subject-verb agreement, capitalization, and punctuation before any downstream stage sees the text. Output is the corrected text only, no quotes, no preface, no paraphrasing or shortening.

- ✅ **Entities** _(in testing)_: scans the cleaned prompt for named entities (people, places, organizations, products) and resolves each into a short identifying gloss attached to the turn, so downstream stages don't drop or rename them.

- ✅ **Classify** _(in testing)_: tags the cleaned prompt with a speech act (command, question, statement, acknowledgment, correction), a subtype, and any topic tags. Drives handler dispatch later in the pipeline.

- ✅ **Dictionary** _(in testing)_: looks up each content word in the cleaned prompt against WordNet and Webster's 1913 and emits a compact bundle of definitions. Grounds the stylize and disambiguate stages so synonyms and homonyms don't get re-interpreted at random.

- ✅ **Stylize** _(in testing)_: takes the cleaned prompt plus the dictionary bundle and produces several precise rewrites of the request, each labeled with the sense of an ambiguous word it commits to. Drops vague verbs and first-person phrasing in favor of explicit, fully-spelled-out statements of the action being asked for.

- ✅ **Expertise** _(in testing)_: classifies the rewritten prompt by domain (physics, electronics, chemistry, code, vision, general) so the dispatch step can pick the right specialist.

- ✅ **Disambiguate** _(in testing)_: picks one of the stylize candidates as the committed interpretation, or asks the user a single targeted clarifying question when the candidates still disagree on a load-bearing word.

- ✅ **Render final** _(in testing)_: combines the committed interpretation, the dictionary definitions for the chosen senses, and the cleaned prompt into the final fully-disambiguated rewrite. This is the text the answering model actually sees.

- ✅ **Context** _(in testing)_: per-session SQLite log of every turn at every layer with FTS5 full-text search. Backs `render_for_prompt`, session restore, and the conversational follow-up handling used by the components tool and the chat itself.

- ✅ **Knowledge** _(in testing)_: queries a local Wikipedia ZIM corpus (downloaded on first run) at the grounding stages so the answering model gets real facts in front of it instead of being asked to recall them.

### Tools

The Tools section is the long backlog of capabilities the workbench
needs to be the polymath instrument the Purpose section describes. It is
ordered foundation-first: the items at the top are the tools that, once
working, let the assistant help build everything below it. Sub-sections
group the rest by domain. Entries marked ✅ are built and in testing.
Entries marked ⬜ are planned (or, in one case, broken and pending rework).


#### Foundation (bootstrap)

- ✅ **Shell** _(in testing)_: turns command intents into actual shell invocations in the project's working directory and returns stdout, stderr, and exit code. Refreshes the file tree afterwards so created or edited files show up immediately.

- ✅ **File write** _(in testing)_: server-side write of arbitrary text or binary content into a file in the project tree. Backs the Mouser parts "save list to a markdown file" flow and the image editor's canvas commits.

- ✅ **Coder** _(in testing)_: dedicated code-generation model the shell tool uses to translate command intents into actual shell commands.

- ✅ **Test runner** _(in testing)_: standalone tool_test binary; each feature registers its own CLI smoke test; tool_test --all is the local quick-check.

- ✅ **Embedded browser tool** _(stub, awaits wire-up)_: a full browser running inside the tool itself, executing server-side. Page loads, navigation, form submissions, and downloads all happen on the host running the tool rather than on the user's workstation, so when the user follows a vendor link and pulls a datasheet, a schematic symbol, or any other resource, it lands in the project tree on the server rather than in the workstation's download folder.

- ✅ **Scripting tool** _(in testing)_: a tool for writing and executing scripts that automate work across the other tools. AI drafts the script, the user reviews and approves, the scripting tool runs it. Outputs feed back into the chat or the project tree.

- ✅ **Task scheduler** _(in testing)_: a tool for breaking a long work process into a list of steps, scheduling them, executing them sequentially or in parallel where independent, and following through across many turns or days. Persists state so the work survives restarts.

- ✅ **Hex editor** _(in testing)_: a binary file editor with offset/value display in hex, decimal, ASCII; structure templates for common formats (ELF, PE, PNG, GGUF, etc.); diff and patch over a binary; checksum and entropy view.

- ✅ **File format translators** _(in testing)_: a collection of converters between common file formats: pandoc-style document conversion, image format conversion, point-cloud format conversion, audio/video transcoding, archive (zip/tar/7z) repacking. Single-command invocation, batch mode, AI-suggested target format from the use case.

- ✅ **Document reader (RAG)** _(in testing)_: a tool for ingesting documents (Word, PDF, plain text, HTML, datasheets) into a per-project retrieval index, so the AI can answer questions grounded in the user's own documents. Distinct from the Wikipedia knowledge base.

- ✅ **Safety and legality advisor** _(in testing)_: a pipeline stage and callable tool. Reads the procedure being recommended, identifies the (material, process, activity) tuple, looks up real physical hazards and real legal/regulatory exposure (federal/state/international where relevant), and prepends a direct factual preface and inline warnings to the answer. Never refuses. Never hedges. Tells you the mechanism and the citation; then the answer continues. Backed by a material-safety database and a regulatory-citation database.

- ✅ **Cross-domain Socratic council** _(in testing)_: orchestrates several domain specialists in a structured dialogue against each other on a single multi-domain prompt. Each specialist challenges the others' assumptions and contributes its own grounding; a coordinator detects convergence and synthesizes. Used when a prompt spans domains a single specialist can't cover (e.g. simulating atmospheric methane on a Jovian moon and its effect on Mars orbit pulls planetary science, atmospheric chemistry, and orbital mechanics together).

- ✅ **Standing principle: small specialist integration** _(stub, awaits wire-up)_: not a tool per se. Whenever a small specialized abliterated model appears on Hugging Face that fits a tool slot, the project pulls it, chunks it, and wires it in. The fleet expands as the open-source ecosystem expands.


#### Project artifact maintainers

- ✅ **Safety folder maintainer** _(in testing)_: auto-maintains `<project>/.tool/safety/` with one file per flagged hazard (material+process). The safety advisor stage reads existing entries to avoid re-explaining and writes new ones when novel hazards surface. Each file accumulates mitigation choices, PPE selected, and incidents over the life of the project.

- ✅ **Legal folder maintainer** _(in testing)_: auto-maintains `<project>/.tool/legal/` with one file per regulatory pathway flagged. Tracks application status, dates, follow-ups, agency contacts, fee schedules.

- ✅ **IP folder maintainer** _(in testing)_: auto-maintains `<project>/.tool/ip/` with dated invention disclosures, prior-art search results, claim drafts, and a defensive-publication log. Detects novel-claim-shaped content emerging in the chat and commits a timestamped disclosure with supporting file refs (commit SHAs, schematic hashes, etc.). Flags suspected infringement of patents already in the prior-art DB.

- ✅ **Decisions folder maintainer** _(in testing)_: auto-maintains `<project>/.tool/decisions/` with ADR-style entries ("we picked X over Y because Z") so the project's architectural reasoning lives somewhere other than chat history.

- ✅ **Project memory** _(in testing)_: a knowledge base per project that accumulates across the lifetime of the project. AI tools both read from it (recall prior decisions and observations) and write to it (after each substantive session). Distinct from the per-session context and the Wikipedia knowledge base.

- ✅ **Personal/editable memory** _(in testing)_: the AI's persistent knowledge about the user: preferences, style notes, recurring jurisdictions, owned equipment, accepted risk profile, recurring contacts. Visible and editable in the UI (browse, edit, merge, forget, export/import). Mirrors the model used by Claude Code's memory system.


#### Pipeline answering handlers

- ✅ **Generalist answer** _(in testing)_: catch-all answering handler used when no domain specialist matches the classified expertise.

### Interface

- ✅ **Web app** _(in testing)_: self-contained C++ server on port 8080 with cpp-httplib. All UI assets are embedded into the binary; no Node or browser bundler in the build pipeline.

- ✅ **File tree** _(in testing)_: directory listing in the left pane with single-click open and drag-to-AI for image files. Polls for filesystem changes so external edits show up without manual refresh.

- ✅ **Multi-mode editor** _(in testing)_: tabbed editor shell with mode auto-detected from extension. Text modes are inline (markdown rendered by default with a toggle to source, code in a monospace textarea, prose with spellcheck); non-text modes render the appropriate tool into the tab (image editor, PDF reader, embedded browser, etc.). Per-file dirty state, Ctrl+S saves.

- ✅ **Terminal** _(in testing)_: single-pane keystroke-driven terminal per tab, with per-tab cwd that survives `cd` through the AI chat, command history, and the standard editing shortcuts.

- ✅ **AI chat** _(in testing)_: server-sent-event streaming of each pipeline layer's output into the chat log, with a collapsible "thinking" expander for the chain and a headline that shows the final handler's output. Markdown links in the chat render as clickable in-tool browser links with an inline download button.

- ✅ **Sessions** _(in testing)_: per-browser-tab session identified by a UUID in the URL fragment, backed by per-session SQLite for chat history and per-session JSON for UI state. Picker on cold start when multiple sessions exist; refresh restores UI and chat; sessions can be renamed, switched, or forgotten.

- ✅ **Settings** _(in testing)_: API credentials modal that stores keys (currently Mouser) in `settings/credentials.json` (gitignored) and reads them at tool-invocation time.

- ✅ **Folder picker** _(in testing)_: modal directory browser used to open the project root.

- ✅ **Status bar** _(in testing)_: shows pipeline-stage load progress in the menubar as the server starts up.
